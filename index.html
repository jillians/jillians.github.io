<h1> Moments </h1>
<div>
  <div>
    <p> The first real crush I had was like </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p> washing your hands in a public restroom and switching sinks halfway through because the one you started with didn't have soap. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <div>
    <p> The first relationship I was in was like </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p> the combination lock clippedonto the railing in the stairway of my middle school that someone does not think is worth bringing out the bolt cutters for, but someone else thought it was worth clipping there in the first place. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <div>
    <p> The first real relationship I had was like</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p>getting up early in the morning and doing everything you need to do, then waking up and realizing it was all a dream and you're half an hour late.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <div>
    <p>All the time I've ever spent alone has been like</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p>laying on your side with one eye closed against your pillow, then turning off the light to find that it's already adjusted to the dark.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <div>
    <p>The relationship I'm in now is like</p>
  </div>
<br>
<div>
  <div>
    <p>when you're waiting in the left turn lane at a stoplight and your blinker perfectly syncs wiht the one from the car in front of you, just for a moment.</p>
